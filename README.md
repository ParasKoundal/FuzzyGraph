The project is inspired by [Equation Shadows](https://gods.art/articles/equation_shadows.html). This is about visualizing equations by showing not just where error = 0 (exact solutions), but also the "error landscape" - creating fuzzy graphs that reveal mathematical features invisible in traditional binary graphing.
